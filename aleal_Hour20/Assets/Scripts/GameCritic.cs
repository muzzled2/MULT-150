    //Is this game too easy or hard?

    //I think its too easy as you can avoid the obstacles and grab the power ups with minimal effort. You don't even need to use the phase ability to avoid them.
    //In fact, using it actually hinders you, by preventing you from grabbing the power ups.

    //What 2 changes would you do to make it easier or harder?

    //I'd increase the speed that obstacles come towards the player and add an additional obstacle type thats unavoidable without using the phase ability.

    //List 2 things that could give it a "wow" factor

    //A power up that increases the Worldspeed further
    //a looping soundtrack to go with the frenetic nature of the game

    //What 2 parts of the game are fun?

    //Avoiding the obstacles and collecting the power ups is fun. That's pretty much all you can do in the game though.

    //What 2 parts of the game are tedious?

    //The player character strafes a bit too slowly for my taste.

    //There's nothing else to do but collect power ups and dodge obstacles.


    //CHANGES

    //obstacle model updated to fit the theme better. slightly more difficult to avoid due to the increased size

    //power up model changed to a clock with plus sign to reflect what it does for the player
